# FastSpeech2
A Tensorflow Implementation of the FastSpeech 2: Fast and High-Quality End-to-End Text to Speech

# [Audio samples](https://dathudeptrai.github.io/FastSpeech2/)
Here is my Audio samples of FastSpeech2, it's comparable with Tacotron-2, I think. You can also hear more samples here [TensorflowTTS](https://tensorspeech.github.io/TensorFlowTTS/)

# Update
- The FastSpeech2 and FastSpeech2s are being implemented on TensorflowTTS repo now, pls move on https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowTTS to update a progress of the implementation.
